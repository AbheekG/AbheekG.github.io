 abstract = {We study the learning and classification of dynamic objects. Active classification, i.e., the sequential decision making process aimed at data acquisition for classification purposes, arises naturally in many applications, including medical diagnosis, intrusion detection, and object tracking. In this work, we study the problem of actively classifying dynamic objects with a finite set of Markov decision process (MDP)  models. First, we give a sample-efficient PAC active learning algorithm that learns the models corresponding to the classes the objects. Second, building upon previous works on active classification algorithms for MDPs, we give a new classification objective and a corresponding algorithm that is robust to approximation errors in the learned MDPs. We prove that our learning and classification algorithms together achieve an approximately optimal classification accuracy.},
